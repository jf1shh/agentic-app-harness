# Accessibility (a11y) Color Contrast

> Relocated from `.agents/AGENTS.md` §6 as part of the rulebook slim-down — see [`docs/SLIM_RULEBOOK_PROPOSAL.md`](../../docs/SLIM_RULEBOOK_PROPOSAL.md). This file is the canonical text; the rulebook itself carries only the one-line index entry below.

- **Accessibility (a11y) Color Contrast**: When designing premium UIs with bright primary/secondary colors (like Emerald or Amber) against white text, standard shades (e.g. 500/600) often fail WCAG 2.0 AA minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1). Always use darker variants (e.g., Emerald 700 `#047857`, Amber 800 `#9a3412`) to ensure `@axe-core/playwright` accessibility checks pass seamlessly.
