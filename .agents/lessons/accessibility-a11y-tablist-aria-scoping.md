- **Accessibility (a11y) Tablist ARIA Scoping**: When implementing tabbed navigation components with `role="tab"`, `@axe-core/playwright` strict WCAG accessibility checks enforce `aria-required-parent` requiring the parent container element to explicitly declare `role="tablist"` (e.g. `<div className="nav-tabs" role="tablist">`).
