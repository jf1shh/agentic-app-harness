# PWA Service Worker Subpath Scoping

> Relocated from `.agents/AGENTS.md` §6 as part of the rulebook slim-down — see [`docs/SLIM_RULEBOOK_PROPOSAL.md`](../../docs/SLIM_RULEBOOK_PROPOSAL.md). This file is the canonical text; the rulebook itself carries only the one-line index entry below.

- **PWA Service Worker Subpath Scoping** `[guardrail: root-service-worker]`: In Vite/React PWA applications deployed under subfolder paths on static hosts like GitHub Pages (`/agentic-app-harness/mood-diner/`), registering root `/sw.js` or caching root `/index.html` causes 404 cache failures. Use dynamic `self.location.pathname` in `sw.js` and `window.location.pathname + 'sw.js'` in `index.html` to guarantee subpath compatibility.
